Pre-Class Surveys
-----------------

For some classes a very brief pre-class survey will be distributed prior to the class session. Survey responses are required, and are expected to demonstrate familiarity with readings and case materials and to find out what issues in the readings are of interest to address during class discussions. Each student is responsible for answering each survey, and they must be completed prior to class to receive full credit.

Term Paper
----------

Term papers are to be prepared in a manner consistent with the highest forms of academic integrity; all sources of data and information are to be cited explicitly in footnotes and complete references. A draft of this paper will be due mid-term and will receive comments by the teaching staff. The final paper of no more than 5,000 words will be due at the end of the term.

There are two options for the paper:

1.  A Corporate Entrepreneurship Tool or Method You Are Interested in
2.  CE Within a Specific Company

### Step 1

Form a team of at least two and not more than three classmates. Select one or the other of the following topics for your study:

**Option 1: Tool or Method:** Pick a tool or method of interest to you, either internal or external. Using the literature and / or interviews prepare a report on how that method is currently being used and if it is being met with success. Example topics can be found in the Glossary: Kiefer, C. [Monograph: "Notes on the Practice of Corporate Entrepreneurship" (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit15_369f15_prcticecrprt), 2016, pp. 56–59.

**Option 2: Company:** Pick a firm that you are interested in and contact one to three people who are knowledgeable about the firm's Corporate Entrepreneurship efforts. Your firm can be found in the literature, in Internet research, introductions from classmates, in our course textbook Corporate Entrepreneurship by Burns, a former employer or a company you are simply interested in, perhaps as a future employer. Use the Corporate Entrepreneurship Interview Guide and / or any additional questions of your own. What is CE to their firm? Why is it important? What challenges do they face? What tools and methods are they having success with (both inside and outside the firm)? Do they have a formal, managed approach to becoming more entrepreneurial and, if so, what is it?

### Step 2

In either case as a team summarize your findings in an approximately five and no more than ten-page report.

### Step 3

You will receive comments by the teaching staff and by other classmates (voluntary). Your final paper is due the last week of class.

Personal Career Reflection
--------------------------

In preparation for the final class you will prepare a short reflection (500± words) on your thoughts on your future regarding corporate entrepreneurship. What has changed, if anything, as a result of this course? This will form the basis of an in-class discussion of the topic.
